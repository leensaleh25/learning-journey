My Learning Projects

Welcome to my personal repository where I document all the projects I've built throughout my learning journey.  
From Python scripts and command-line tools to data science experiments and web apps â€” everything lives here.

 ðŸ“‚ Projects Included

- SkillTrackerCLI : A command-line app to manage and export your skills using SQLite and CSV

- More coming soon...

Purpose

This repository helps me:
- Track my progress
- Practice new concepts
- Build a portfolio of real projects
- Share my learning with others

How to Use

Each project is organized in its own folder.  
To run a project, navigate to its directory and follow the instructions in its README file (if available).


Feel free to explore, learn, and get inspired!
